## About me
I am Angelica, I currently hold a position as a PhD student at the Sociology Department at Tilburg University (the Netherlands) and I am also an assistant of the Methodology Group of the European Values Study ([EVS](https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/)), and member of the EVS Operational and Planning Group. 

In the last 5 years I gained significant experience in conducting academic research at the intersection between sociology and survey methodology, by combining substantive research for the PhD with operational work for the European Values Study. 

For my PhD thesis, I apply sociological theories, e.g. Beck's reflexive modernization and Inglehart's cultural backlash, to understand how individuals cope with datafication processes, often applying a cross-cultural comparative perspective. I mostly use survey data and quantitative statistical methods. Examples of my research questions are: whether and why there is an educational gradient in e-privacy management and whether it varies by the level of digitalization of a country, or whether trust in social media among the Dutch citizens eroded as a consequence of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. At the moment, I am working on a paper on the acceptability of a Covid-19 passport among the Dutch citizens, and on the educational gradient in acceptance of surveillance among European citizens.

In my free time I love knitting, playing the harp and pole dancing. I also love food - eating it more than cooking it.
