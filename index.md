Currently a PhD student at the Sociology Department at Tilburg University and Assistant of the Methodology Group of the European Values Study (EVS). My research interests span between sociology, communication and survey methodology. My main areas of interest are:
- the digital divide (e.g. how are social inequalities reproduced in the online domain?)
- privacy, surveillance & trust in digital societies
- (web) survey design

[Here](/publications.md) is a list of my publications.
