## About me
I am Angelica, I currently hold a position as a PhD student at the Sociology Department at Tilburg University (the Netherlands) and I am also an assistant of the Methodology Group of the European Values Study ([EVS](https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/)). My research interests span between sociology, communication and survey methodology. My main areas of interest are:
- the digital divide
- privacy, surveillance & trust in digital societies
- (web) survey design.

[Here](/publications.md) is a list of my publications.

In my free time I love knitting, playing the harp and pole dancing.
