19MAG001,Gene-environment interplay in education: the impact of school quality and tracking,Antonie Knigge; Kim Stienstra; Ineke Maas,,UU - FSW,2019,MAG,,"Perceptions of neighbourhood conditions – no matter how accurate or biased – can have real consequences for neighbourhoods and individuals, and might even be more important than the objective characteristics. This study investigates how important these neighbourhood perceptions are for understanding individual outcomes (i.a. trust, inter-ethnic attitudes, unsafety feelings), and will provide insight in how these perceptions are shaped. Understanding the impact of perceptions can help to design better policies, which are often based on objectively measured characteristics of residential environments. The LISS panel data will be linked to the CBS microdata to construct objective neighbourhood characteristics for all panel members at multiple geographical scales. ",,,,
19MAG002,Determinants of Civic versus Economic Outcomes of Dutch Secondary Education,Hester Mennes,,UvA - Faculteit der Maatschappij en Gedragswetenschappen,2019,MAG,,"After the World Health Organization called for a broader approach to mental health, well-being has become increasingly important in the field of mental health, both in research and in practice. Good measurement instruments are needed to routinely monitor the well-being of clients. The Mental Health Continuum – Short Form (MHC-SF) has been validated in population studies, but in mental health practice clients experience a number of problems when filling out the items regarding the response format, formulations and relevance of the items. This proposal aims to validate a revised version of the instrument. We experiment with the different versions, assess the psychometric properties of the revised scale, and use innovative ways to compare scores on the old and new version. Furthermore, we compare the results to a population study carried out in the LISS panel ten years ago as well as to a study carried out in clinical practice. The study will result in a new instrument that can be used in research and practice.  ",,,,

20MAG001,Do neighbourhoods affect health? Disentangling selection and causation,Joost Oude Groeniger; Nienke Boderie;  Hans van Kippersluis,Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam (EUR) - Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,EUR-ESSB,2020,MAG,,"The Participation Act was introduced on the 1th of January 2015, in order to create a more inclusive labor market in The Netherlands. The actual execution of the Act is decentralized. Municipalities are responsible for encouraging firms to create labor opportunities for vulnerable groups. Municipalities adopt different mean and instruments to do so, consequently there exist a variety of municipal policies (Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, 2019). Currently, there is no public readily available CBS data on the 'inclusiveness' of firms among municipalities, which makes it hard to assess the effectiveness of municipal policies and derive best practices. However, this data is key, in exploring why one municipal policy is more effective in stumulating inclusion of vulnerable grous, than another. Specifically, this study aims to answer the following research question: ""Which/ what factors underlying differences in municipal inclusive policies explain differences in inclusion rates of vulnerable groups among firms?"". We develop and test a theoretical model of how differences in municipal policies and their effects come about by connecting institutional- with policy diffusion theory. Empirically we aim to examine inclusive behavior of firms among all 380 municipalities in The Netherlands among the period between 2014 and 2019. We will use a variety of methods including machine learning. We intend to make several contributions to theory and practice- i.e. by showing how content of policies come about and effect inclusiveness. ",,,,

The effects of the National Program Rotterdam South on educational mobility,Gijs Custers,Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam (EUR) - Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,EUR-ESSB,2020,MAG,,"In this project, we plan to document a set of new facts about the income risk that Dutch households are exposed to and to study its effects on their portfolio choice and savings behavior. We focus in particular on the heterogeneous exposure to aggregate conditions of household income. We call this systematic income risk (or worker beta). We document how systematic income risk varies across age groups, gender, recent earnings and occupation. Next, we study how systematic income risk is related to household portfolio choice, and how it affects the riskiness and liquidity of household portfolios.",,,,
20MAG003,From inside prison to a prison outside: Re-integration and recidivism during the corona-crisis,Elanie Rodermond,Nederlands Studiecentrum Criminaliteit en Rechtshandhaving (NSCR),NSCR,2020,MAG,,"Over the last 50 years, macro-economic changes have resulted in the emergence and proliferation of new working conditions. This ‘New Work’ is characterized by an increase in the share of workers with temporary contracts, self-employment with no personnel (ZZP'er), part-time work and non-standard work hours, remote working, and complex work histories. The consequences of New Work for the family life chances of young adults have largely been overlooked and understudied. This project explores the relationship between experiences of New Work and subsequent union formation, childbearing, and union dissolution. Combining detailed data on working conditions from the Dutch Labor Force Survey (Enquête beroepsbevolking, EBB) and administrative register data, I will identify New Workers and follow them prospectively, observing their family-life-course dynamics. I will unravel the complex relationship between New Work and family life chances, exploring critical ages when exposure to New Work may be helpful or harmful for family building and stability. With survey and administrative data since 1996, I will identify stability and change in the consequences of New Work, from a time when it was marginal until today, when it is increasingly commonplace. Documenting and extrapolating from trends in the family outcomes of New Workers will provide insights into what the future might hold, also for those experiencing New Work for the first time as a result of the current Covid-19 crisis.",,,,
20MAG004,Does the lack of collateral prevent the creation and growth of small businesses?,Daniel Karpati,Tilburg University (TiU) - Tilburg School of Economics and Management,TiSEM,2020,MAG,,"Scientific interest in suicidal acts (attempted and completed suicides) spans a wide range of disciplines from epidemiology, through economics, psychology, and unquestionably – sociology. Though theoretically well-informed, one of the leading challenges in the study of suicidal acts has unquestionably been methodological, namely, the availability of high-quality, individual-level data. The goal of this project is two-fold: first, to present a clear descriptive analysis of the age, period, and cohort trends in suicidal acts (successful and attempted suicides) for Dutch men and women. This is an essential step for two reasons: 1) it allows to better understand the magnitude of the potential societal problem and 2) it facilitates the subsequent theorizing about the possible causes of changes in patterns of suicidal behaviours for specific groups of individuals. Second, I will focus on socioeconomic and family-related drivers of suicidal behaviours of Dutch men and women. When studying potential socioeconomic differentials in suicidal behaviours, one of the key questions will be whether an individual’s own resources act as a protective factor against suicidal acts or whether it is that individual’s position, relative-to-others, that matters. In the study of the importance of uninterrupted family ties, specific attention will be paid to the potential weakening over time of the buffering role which partnerships might play against suicidal acts.",,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3772659,,
20MAG005,The 30%-rule for expats: impact on immigration and wages,Massimo Giuliodori,Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA) - Faculteit Economie en Bedrijfskunde,UvA-FEB,2020,MAG,,"Dutch children with similar IQ are twice as likely to attain higher education when their parents are highly educated compared to when parents are lower educated. The magnitude of such unequal opportunities is thought to depend on characteristics of the school environment, such as school quality and the way children are tracked into different educational levels. However, testing these claims is problematic with conventional sociological methods, because it is difficult to measure to what extent educational outcomes depend on “family background” rather than “ability”. This project takes a different approach and applies twin methods to administrative data available through Statistics Netherlands (CBS) to investigate the interplay between genes, family background, and school characteristics. Twin methods allow to disentangle genetic from environmental influences and investigate the interaction between them. The CBS administrative data have notable advantages over twin samples because of their size, representativeness and coverage. This design will therefore greatly improve our understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying educational inequality. We assess the potential effectiveness of proposed Dutch educational reforms by measuring the school characteristics targeted by these reforms (i.e., school quality, standardization of tracking). Results will directly feed into policymakers because of a close collaboration with the Inspectorate of Education.",,,,
20MAG006,The influence of regional logics in altering organizational behavior in decentralized states,Koen Kuijper; Michel Ehrenhard,"Universiteit Twente (UT) - Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences",UT-BMS,2020,MAG,,"Educational failure, such as grade retention, drop-down or drop-out, has been associated with poor mental health in children and adults. This association could be due to a causal effect of educational failure, but it is also likely to result, at least in part, from the presence of confounding factors affecting both education and health, such as for example parental socioeconomic status. We propose to take advantage of the shared genetic and familial environment between siblings to test the association between educational failure and mental health, controlled for observed and unobserved confounders. Our main analysis will consist of a within- and between-family regression of secondary-school educational failure on early adulthood mental health, estimated from CBS health costs and medication data. 
As a follow-up study, we will investigate potential modifiable factors increasing the risk of educational failure. First, using the same sibling control design, we will investigate the effect of misassignment of pupils to a secondary education track, that is, too low or too high according to the CITO score and teacher advice on school track. Second, combining CBS data with genetic data available in the Netherlands Twin Registry (NTR) allows us to investigate the effect of primary and secondary school socioeconomic status on educational failure, while accounting for the non-random placement of students in schools. 
With this project, we aim at better estimating the relationship between education failure and mental health and at identifying modifiable factors affecting educational failure in a large and unbiased population. Our project makes a critical advance over other studies by using a sibling design, allowing us to control for the presence of both measured and unmeasured confounders.

20MAG007,Systematic Income Risk,Giuseppe Floccari; Paul Muller,Tilburg University (TiU) - Tilburg School of Economics and Management,TiSEM,2020,MAG,,"Of the money earned by companies, an increasing proportion is going to the owners by way of profits, and a decreasing proportion is paid out to both the owners of capital and the workers (Barkai, 2017). The redistribution that accompanies such an increase in market power has been directly linked to increasing inequality and its broader societal consequences (Piketty, 2015; Atkinson, 2015). A suggested reason for this trend is increasing market concentration, although no causal evidence exists as of yet. In this research project I investigate the causal effect on market power of a common shifter in market concentration: mergers and acquisitions. With the unique combination of large-scale CBS microdata, and novel empirical techniques, I can asses whether changes in market power due to mergers are based on efficiencies. This research project contributes to the academic understanding of mergers, which is now based on small-scale studies of particular industries, and relies on restrictive assumptions.",,,,
20MAG008,New work and the family life course in the Netherlands (NeWFam-NL),Jennifer Holland,Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam (EUR) - Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,EUR-ESSB,2020,MAG,,"Education fulfils a vital role in preparing generations for the future. This involves an economic and a civic task: to provide youngsters labour market qualification, and to prepare them for participation in society and democracy. Determinants of  school effectiveness for fulfilment of the economic task have been extensively studied, and this is also increasingly the case for schools’ civic task. Only scarcely, however, have determinants been examined for both economic and civic performance within one school. At the same time, changing international labour markets and increasingly complex societies suggest that schools’ economic and civic tasks will increasingly overlap. This urges insight in the effect of school characteristics on fulfilment of both instead of one task. The aim of this project is to contribute to the understanding of the relation between economic and civic performance within schools, and examine what factors determine this relation. In particular, the role of school policy (that is, educational task priority and implementation) and school resources (that, means to realise the policy) will be studied for different school types. As is necessary for all school effectiveness research, school composition in terms of parental background will be included to reliably identify the contribution of schools. Data on civic and economic performance on 205 Dutch secondary schools is already available, yet a link with Microdata from Statistics Netherlands is vital for realising reliable estimates of school compositions. Two types of analyses will be conducted: a multinomial logistic regression analysis aggregated to the school level (Study A), and a multilevel linear regression analysis at school and student level (Study B). This allows to examine the impact of school type, policy and resources on the relation between schools’ economic and civic performance (Study A), and on students’ civic performance within schools that differ in economic performance (Study B).  By means of these studies, the project aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of economic and civic performance within schools, and to provide new and increasingly relevant insight in what can be done to enhance both.

21MAG001,Private Equity investment in the Netherlands: who benefits?,Rob Timans; Dirk Bezemer; Johan Heilbron,,TiU-TSB,2021,MAG,,"Private Equity (PE) is a form of finance in which a group of investors invests in companies for a limited time period. PE is hotly contested. In some high-profile cases, PE investments led to substantial financial difficulties for companies (such as HEMA). The recent expansion of PE into sectors that are traditionally not for-profit (such as health care and day nurseries) have led to further public unease and political scrutiny.This gives rise to important questions. Should these activities be welcomed? Are the problems related to PE investment to be viewed as incidents? Or do they indicate structural problems with PE involvement?Academic research into these questions has not yielded clear answers. The main reason for this is the lack of adequate data.The original contribution of this research will be a comprehensive study into the longer-term effects of PE activity specifically for a large number of Dutch firms. A second novelty is that we will build a unique firm-level dataset which brings together information from seven sources. This will allow us to ask new questions, and find new answers.",,,,
21MAG002,Parental transition and healthy lifestyle choices,Kim Fairley; Jim Been,,UL-Law,2021,MAG,,"With age, lifestyle habits become increasingly unmalleable. It is therefore crucial to raise children who are equipped to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our research question asks whether parents are able to act as good role models of a healthy lifestyle for their children? With regard to smoking, recent evidence suggests that parental transition positively contributes to smoking cessation. Our first aim is to investigate whether this positive effect also holds for other lifestyle factors. At the same time, parental transition is accompanied by intensified psychosocial stress, resulting in an increase of major depression during the postpartum period. Our second aim focuses on the combined effect of parental transition and mental health on labor market outcomes. Based on our findings, our results serve as input to policy concerned with accommodating parental transition in their multifaceted role of raising healthy children and participating on the Dutch labor market.",,,,
21MAG003,Using big data to give children a promising start in life,Bastian Ravesteijn; Coen Van de Kraats,,EUR-ESE,2021,MAG,,"One in seven children in the Netherlands is deprived of a healthy life start in life. Routinely collected data on individual’s health and socio-economic factors offer exceptional opportunities to support professionals in prevention and health care, in particular those who work in midwifery, gynaecology and preventive youth health care (Jeugdgezondheidszorg). The aim of this project is to personalize prevention and care from the moment a child is conceived throughout childhood. We will bring novel PYHC data into the Statistics Netherlands (CBS) secure microdata environment and work together with our PYHC partners to assess and improve the quality of these data. Next, we will document how, when, and where the “childhood opportunity gap” opens up in the Netherlands. Finally, we will use information that is available during gestation or in early childhood to predict later childhood outcomes, in order to better target existing preventive actions to children and (future) parents.",,,,
21MAG004,"Less for more? Family size, child allowances, and child outcomes: Evidence from a Dutch reform",Gabriele Mari,,EUR- ESSB,2021,MAG,,"Worldwide, families with young children receive cash transfers from the state in the form of child allowances. Falling more often below poverty lines, children in larger families arguably have more to benefit from these transfers. In the Netherlands, payments used to go up with the number of children, but a flat, per-child payment came into force in 1995. While most previous studies have focused on short-term changes to family income and with no distinctions by family size, this policy was the source of long-lasting variation in family income, especially in large families. I thus study whether and how children in larger families were affected by the 1995 reform, examining child outcomes from early childhood to early adulthood, and across the socioeconomic spectrum. As many countries, from the US to Italy, are currently introducing or expanding child allowances, the study can provide timely policy recommendations.",,,,
21MAG005,The Efficacy of Energy Efficiency: Home Insulation and Residential Gas Use,Linde Kattenberg; Piet Eichholtz; Niels Kok,,UM-SBE,2021,MAG,,"Improving the energy efficiency of the building stock is of significant importance in decreasing household energy consumption. One way to improve the energy efficiency of a home is through insulation measures. Using unique, hand-collected data on insulation measures, this study examines the effect of wall and basement insulation on gas consumption in a large sample of (rental and owner-occupied) residential homes. We test for heterogeneous effects across types of homes, and across household characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate long-run gas consumption after the energy efficiency improvements, to address potential concerns of a rebound effect. Insights from this study contribute to better estimates on the returns to home insulation. These results can inform homeowners and housing corporations in their home retrofitting decision, reducing their investment uncertainty. The results can also inform policymakers on the efficacy of energy efficiency in the housing market, which represents an important pillar in reducing national carbon emissions.",,,,
21MAG006,Genetic and environmental determinants of socioeconomic status in the Lifelines cohort,Sjoerd van Alten; Titus Galama,,VU-SBE,2021,MAG,,"Inequality in income and wealth is pervasive and growing in the Netherlands and other developed countries. Research in social science genetics has demonstrated that genes, socioeconomic environmental factors and their interaction each contribute substantially to the determination of socioeconomic outcomes. However, the environmental pathways through which genetic endowments translate into socioeconomic status (SES) are poorly understood. Our proposed study combines measures of genetic endowments in the Dutch Lifelines cohort with high-quality CBS microdata on SES (income, wealth, job type and education), based on administrative records. This uniquely linked dataset allows us to 1) estimate causal genetic effects (by conditioning on the parental genotype), 2) estimate causal environmental effects (by exploring natural experiments), and 3) explore extremely rich measures of SES, in the study of gene-by-environment interplay. Their combination is a first in this literature. Our study will improve understanding of the environmental pathways through which genetic endowments translate into SES.  ",,,,
